# Network analyzer troubleshooting Script  

This script is designed to test a network resource and gather information for accurate troubleshooting.  

## Features  

- Operates at the network and port levels.  
- Launches `tcpdump` during all tests to sniff traffic sent to the target machine.  
  - Provides a comprehensive overview for advanced network analysis.  
- Performs the following tests:  
  - **Ping**  
  - **Traceroute**  
  - Option to perform a DNS lookup (`dig`) on an IP or DNS name.  
  - Option to test if the target's TCP port is open using **Nmap**.
  - tcpdump that records all activies.

## Recommended Usage  

1. Run the script to perform initial network tests.  
2. As a final step, test the target's service:
   - Try to login if it's a webpage or try to reach it. 
   - Logging in via SSH or any other service the target has.  
4. The ongoing `tcpdump` collects all traffic, allowing for advanced analysis.  
5. When testing is complete, type `ok` and `ENTER` to terminate the script.

## Compatibility  

- This script has been tested on **MX Linux** and works perfectly.  
- Feel free to test it on other systems.
- If you encounter issues or want to improve the script, contributions are welcome!  

## Prerequisites  

Ensure the following packages are installed for full functionality:  
- `tcpdump`  
- `ping`  
- `traceroute`  
- `dig`  
- `nmap`  

## How to Use

1. **Make sure that you have the necessary packets**  
   Commands for debian and redhat distros:
   ```bash
   apt install traceroute nmap bind9utils tcpdump -y
   
   dnf install traceroute nmap bind-utils tcpdump -y

2. **Clone or Download the Repository**  
   Download the script to your system or clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eugeniogiusti/network_analyzer.git
   
   cd network_analyzer


3. Grant Execution Permissions
Give the script executable permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x network_analyzer.sh


4. Run the Script &
Switch to the root user if you don't want to enter the password during the process:
   ```bash
   sudo su
   ./network_analyzer.sh


5. Step follow the instructions
   ```bash
   Follow the instruction of the script.
   You have to put your ip target and its port and that's it!


6. Step read and import
   ```bash
   Read the report .txt and import the .pcap in Wishareshark to analazite it or use tcpdump with this command:
   tcpdump -r file.pcap

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Check the target's firewall**  
   Ensure the service ports for incoming connections are open.

2. **Verify services and configurations**  
   Confirm that the services are running and check for any misconfigurations at the application level.

3. **Inspect Layer 3 and Layer 2 issues**  
   Look for potential problems, such as:
   - Improperly configured routing.
   - VLAN ACLs blocking traffic.

4. **Investigate software/firmware bugs**  
   Check for any known bugs in the software or firmware.
